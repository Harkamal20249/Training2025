    üí¨ Think of it like:
    A messenger between you and the computer‚Äôs brain (kernel).
  
    You type a command like:

    Bash takes it, understands it, and tells the computer what to do.

 # sh shell
    sh is a basic shell (a command-line interpreter).
    It reads and runs commands, like echo, ls, cd, etc.
    You use it to run scripts written in a file.
    Think of sh like a robot that reads your .sh file line by line and does what you tell it to.

# .sh file
    A .sh file is just a text file full of Linux commands.
    It usually starts with this line:
    #!/bin/sh
  
    That line tells the computer:
    ‚ÄúUse the sh shell to run this file.‚Äù

**_What happens in the background_**

    Imagine sh is a person reading your .sh file:
    sh says: Okay, I see "echo Hello", I will say Hello.
